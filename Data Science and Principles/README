# Data Science Projects

This repository contains various data science projects completed as part of my academic and personal work.

## Project Overview

###  Regression and Validation
- **Objective:** Utilize the "ftsw" variable to predict the values of "lfgr" using regression models.
- **Tools & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
- **Key Features:**
  - Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression (Degree 3 and Degree 9)
  - Cross-validation for overfitting detection
  - Comparison of regression models by MSE, RMSE, and R-squared metrics
- **Results:**
  - Detailed analysis and comparison of the performance of different regression models.
  - Visualization of regression fits and error metrics.
